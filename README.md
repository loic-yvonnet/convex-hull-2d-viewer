<h1>Convex Hull 2D Viewer</h1>

This QT viewer enables testing the algorithms from the <a href="https://github.com/loic-yvonnet/convex-hull-cpp14">Convex Hull Algorithms in C++14</a> repository. It uses also the <a href="https://github.com/loic-yvonnet/randomize-cpp14">C++14 random numbers library</a>.

This viewer contains a widget for the rendering area, which displays a coordinate system, and a "Generate" button which generates up to 1000 points with coordinates ranging from (-40, -40) to (40, 40), and the convex hull for this set of points.
